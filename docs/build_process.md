# Description of the Build Process

This document describes the process used to build images using OSBS. It sums up how different components of the system communicate to achieve the result.

## Components

This document mentions several components that communicate with each other:

 * [osbs-client](https://github.com/projectatomic/osbs-client)
 * [Openshift v3](https://github.com/openshift/origin/)
 * [atomic-reactor](https://github.com/projectatomic/atomic-reactor)

## The Process

 1. user runs `osbs build` or a Python process calls `osbs.api.OSBS().create_build()`.
 2. osbs-client determines the base layer for the image it's building; let's call base layer *BL* and the image that's being built *IM*.
 3. osbs-client determines name of [Openshift's BuildConfig](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/builds.html#defining-a-buildconfig) to use and makes sure no other build is running for it (only one build for a given `BuildConfig` is allowed to be running at a time).
 4. osbs-client updates Openshift's `BuildConfig` values for current build of *IM*. Most importantly, it makes sure that:
   * `ImageStream` for *BL* is in triggers. This ensures that when *BL* is rebuilt, *IM* is rebuilt as well.
   * `is_autorebuild` label is set to `"false"`, so that atomic-reactor knows that this is a build executed by user.
   * the `BuildConfig`'s source git ref names the git branch the build is from
   * the `bump_release` configuration names the branch's commit the initial build is from
   * the `stop_autorebuild_if_disabled` configuration names the config file where autorebuilds are enabled/disabled, see [OSBS repo configuration file](#osbs-repo-configuration-file)
 5. osbs-client starts the Openshift build from `BuildConfig` for *IM*.
 6. Openshift spawns a new build container that contains atomic-reactor inside.
 7. atomic-reactor's `CheckAndSetRebuildPlugin` is run. This determines whether the build is an automatically triggered autorebuild by examining `is_autorebuild` label. If this is autorebuild, then TODO. If this is not autorebuild, then the `is_autorebuild` label of the `BuildConfig` is set to `"true"`. This is done in order to ensure that all subsequent builds (except user-executed builds) are marked as autorebuild.
 8. atomic-reactor builds the image.
 9. Assuming the build is successful, atomic-reactor pushes the built image into registry and runs post-build plugins. These can vary depending on configuration, but usually it means pushing image to Pulp or so.
 10. atomic-reactor's `ImportImagePlugin` is run, which checks whether ImageStream for *IM* exists. If not, it creates it. Then, either way, it imports newly built *IM* into the `ImageStream`. If there are already some other images that use *IM* as their base image, they get rebuilt.


### docker registry v1 API (current workflow)

You can choose if you want to push built image into:

 * upstream docker registry — can be configured with `registry_uri` — you can suffix it with `/v1` to make reactor sure it's talking to `v1` registry:

    ```ini
    registry_uri = registry.example.com/v1
    ```

   if registry requires authentication, a dockercfg should be stored in the secret:
   ```ini
   registry_secret = dockercfg_secret
   ```

 * pulp registry — can be configured with `pulp_registry_name`, atomic-reactor will `upload` image (as archive) and copies it into required repository


### docker registry v2 API

Since in v2 there is no file-like representation of an image, you can transport image only via registry protocol.

In order to create a v2 form, you need an instance of [distribution](https://github.com/docker/distribution) registry. Once you push the built image there, it's up to you, if you want to move the v2 image into pulp registry. That process is called sync. Configuration is same as for v1 except that you should suffix value of `registry_uri` with `/v2`, e.g.:

```ini
registry_uri = registry.example.com/v2
```

Configuration of pulp registry where images should be synced can be done via:

```ini
pulp_sync_registry_name = stage-pulp
```

If this is not specified, value of `pulp_registry_name` is used.

pulp sync command (the way to get image from distribution to pulp) is requested when `v2` is in `registry_api_versions`.


### Parallel v1 and v2 builds

It's possible to implement your workflow so your build emits images in multiple hybrid registries: pulp v1, pulp v2, v1 upstream registry, v2 upstream registry. Use configuration mentioned in the two sections above.

This is how you can configure your workflow to make your image available via v1 and v2 crane API (crane is pulp component which provides registry API):

```ini
# upstream docker registry -- distribution, which implements v2 API
registry_uri = registry.example.com/v2
# configuration for pulp where we sync from distribution
pulp_sync_registry_name = stage-pulp
pulp_sync_secret = stage-pulp-secret
# configuration for pulp where we upload v1 image directly
pulp_registry_name = stage-pulp2
pulp_secret = stage-pulp2-secret
# we want to do v1 and v2 "pushes" to pulp
registry_api_versions = v1,v2
```


## OSBS Repo Configuration File

OSBS repo config file is a file that resides in the top level of built Git repo. It is currently not mandatory. The default name is `.osbs-repo-config`.

Currently, only `[autorebuild]` section is supported and `enabled` argument inside that. The `enabled` argument is a boolean, recognized values are 0, false, 1 and true (case insensitive). For example:

```ini
[autorebuild]
enabled=1
```

`enabled` is true by default (e.g. if the file is not present or the value is not set in the config file).
